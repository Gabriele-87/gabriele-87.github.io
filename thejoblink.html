    <h2 class="section-title">Project goal ðŸ”Ž</h2>
    <p class="section-content">The JobLink is a job-searching service that targets first-generation immigrants.</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Target audience</h2>
    <p class="section-content">First-generation immigrants, age bracket 18-65</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Project duration</h2>
    <p class="section-content">December 2022 - January 2023</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Problem statement</h2>
    <p class="section-content">The job-hunting process for a first-generation immigrant (First-gen) is often too complicated and frustrating. Our goal is to overcome language and cultural barriers, allowing first-gen immigrants to integrate into the local job market.</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Research study details</h2>
    <p class="section-content">The job-hunting process can be very frustrating for first-generation immigrants. There are many factors in play: language and cultural barriers and lack of networking are the main ones. An important issue that I havenâ€™t considered in my initial assumptions is also a lack of recognition of qualifications and experience in their home country.</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Ideation: initial design concepts</h2>

    <h2 class="section-title">Lo-Fi prototype</h2>
    <p class="section-content">The main flow begins with the onboarding process and it ends with a download page for resume template.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">User testing and iteration</h2>
    <p class="section-content">After conducting an unmoderated usability study we noticed the following pain points: Users found the home page a bit too overwhelming, the call to action on the resume page is not clear, accessibility issues with buttons and labels. Following the usability study I decided to redesign the home page to improve the UX experience. The resume page has been partly redesigned and some other minor UI elements have been changed.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Final Mockups</h2>
    <p class="section-content">All the main pages are reachable from the home page. The main services offered by the platform are available above the fold on the home page and are also grouped in the nav bar under the "our services" link.</p>
    <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion & takeaways ðŸ“£</h2>
    <p class="section-content">The design is consistent throughout the different screen sizes. The home page in the desktop version provides more information and content. All the users have the chance to select their preferred language during the onboarding process. A great idea was to integrate a gamified induction process. The goal is to inform the user about cultural differences and local traditions. This could help speed up migrant integration in local communities. The feedback from the users has been very supportive since the early stage of the design thinking process. This made me realize how a platform like this can really be helpful for the first-gen community.</p>
